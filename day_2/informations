-----> Data types <-----
* Strings:
- putting squared brackets and some values inside, printing it will show only the character with that number. This method of getting a character out of a string is called subscripting
- starting with negative numbers will start the counting from back to the start.

* Integers:
- are whole numbers without any decimal places
- for larger number we can separate them by using "_" instead of "," so we wont mixe them up

* Floats:
- are numbers  with decimal places
- float is the shorter version for floating point number

* Booleans
- Booleans have only 2 values: True or False
- Booleans are ALLWAYS starting with capital T and capital F

* Type conversions
- we can transform almost any data we want into another data type by using the built in functions

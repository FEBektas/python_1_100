-----> String Manipulation <-----
adding a /n to the end of the string will make the next sentence on the following line, this will save more time and space as we dont have to write another print statement.
* concatenating a string - we combine different strings so they will be added to the end of another string by using the "+" sign. String concatenations means taking separate characters and putting them inside one string
*  variables - giving a name to a piece of data will store that date, and that date stored will be called a variable. That name can be change whenever we want as its name suggest.
Rules of naming variables :
1. Make sure your variables names are descriptive
2. Don't have spaces between words
3. Don't start with numbers
4. Don't use special words like "print" or "input"

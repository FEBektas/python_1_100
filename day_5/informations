** - LOOPS -
* - For Loops - using for loops we can go through each item in a list and perform some actions with each individual item.
* - We starting by using the keyword "for" and then we give a name (Like we do with variables) and then we use the "in" keyword and finally the list we wanna loop through.
* - The name that we are declaring works like a variable where the language will assign the name to each item in the list, creating a variable.

** - Sum - will lets us add any iterable data type (including lists) and will add each of the list items.
** - The Range function is really really helpfully if we want to generate a range of numbers too loop through. This functions need to work in conjunction with another function as it will not work independently.
